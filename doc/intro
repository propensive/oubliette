_Oubliette_ provides a convenient way to launch a new JVM instance by specifying the classpath, main method and
arguments to be invoked. Classes may be pre-loaded, providing near-instantaneous JVM startup time. This provides
similar functionality to invoking a main method through a classloader, but with significantly better isolation
from the initiating JVM.
